1. If you invert sign twice, it sets the number to 0
    Fixed with conditional checking if first element in array is a negative sign
2. Main view not being set when typing in numbers, only after a calculation
    Fixed using arr = [...secondNum, val] and setView(arr) logic in the typing conditional, rather 
    than using setView((secondNum) => [...secondNum, val])
