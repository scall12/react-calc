1. If you invert sign twice, it sets the number to 0
    Fixed with conditional checking if first element in array is a negative sign
2. Main view not being set when typing in numbers, only after a calculation
    Fixed using arr = [...secondNum, val] and setView(arr) logic in the 
    typing conditional, rather than using 
    setView((secondNum) => [...secondNum, val])
3. If the returned total is negative, then the array passed to the 
    firstNum only has one element (which is negative). Inverting the sign 
    then breaks the next calculation.
4. After calculation, with state set for firstNum, if the invert sign is pressed,
     it inverts the sign on the firstNum state, but not the view.
