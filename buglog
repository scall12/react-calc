1. If you invert sign twice, it sets the number to 0
    Fixed with conditional checking if first element in array is a negative sign
2. Main view not being set when typing in numbers, only after a calculation
    Fixed using arr = [...secondNum, val] and setView(arr) logic in the 
    typing conditional, rather than using 
    setView((secondNum) => [...secondNum, val])
3. If the returned total is negative, then the array passed to the 
    firstNum only has one element (which is negative). Inverting the sign 
    then breaks the next calculation.
